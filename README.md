# mood

## ❓About

Mood is an ambient music generator. Pick a mood that you want the music to try and reflect, and it'll play accordingly. 

Optional tweaks such as occasional melody and white noise can accompany the music.

This wouldn't be possible without the wonderful [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)

This project was originally kicked off with some Claude.AI vibe-coding, as I am most 
certainly not a web designer, nor am I really much of a Javascript programmer! But as 
the size of the project grew larger I was forced to ultimately take over.
